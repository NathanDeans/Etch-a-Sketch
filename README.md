# Etch-a-Sketch

This is an assignment from the Odin project. 

This etch sketch allows users to enter a number as an input. 

This number is used to make a square grid that acts as a simple etch-a-sketch.

As users hover over the squares in the etch-a-sketch they will change the colour of the squares. 

The board also features a reset button to clear all the images. As well as several other features which change the board visually.
